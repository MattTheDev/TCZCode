# Dawgeth's TCZ Commands and Projects

I've connected to The Chatting Zone (TCZ) since April 5th, 1998. I was 10 days shy of my 14th birthday. Eventually life happened, I connected less - I'd go back to say hi to old friends, make some new ones, and then disappear and go where life would take me. TCZ would ultimately shut down sadly. However .. along came COVID. And voila! we're back.

Diving back in, 10 years after becoming a developer, I wanted to start coding on TCZ and seeing what I could come up with. So this is where I'm going to dump those projects - maybe someone can learn from what I'm doing!
